# The Describer

A web application that uses AI to generate descriptive text from uploaded images. Users can drag and drop or click to upload images, adjust the desired description length using a slider (1-100 words), and receive AI-generated descriptions powered by Claude.

The app features a clean, responsive interface with drag-and-drop functionality, loading states, error handling, and copy-to-clipboard capabilities. Users can easily clear their work and start over with new images.
